- 👋 Hi, I’m @Mark-Nettleship
- 👀 I’m interested in creating UIs, automating tasks, and creating tools to make life easier.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use GitHub. Please excuse any weird mistakes - I'm still new at this!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on basic projects to build my experience.
- 📫 You can reach me through email at mnettleship.dev@gmail.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: I do MMA and jiujitsu in my spare time and occasionally win.
